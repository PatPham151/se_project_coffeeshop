## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :I think I would've made the login actually functionable. As it is right now the data goes nowhere. 

- nov 11: I was unable to diagnose the problem you sent me screen shot of as it was functioning properly on my side and well as when I made the repository public and let a tutor view it. Their solution was to resubmit. Thank you. 


Project name.
Project description (i.e. describe the functionality and the technologies used).
Plans for improving the project. While working on the project, you might have some ideas on how to improve the webpage, such as extra styling or useful features. Try coming up with at least one improvement that you’d like to implement in the future, or learn how to implement. This doesn’t mean you’ll have to work on it, but doing so would be a real plus for your portfolio. It shows that you can think larger, express your individuality, and do more than simply follow instructions.
